- =playerctl= for media control
- =scrot= for screenshot
- =lightdm= for screen lock and display manager (set this up for your own distro)

** Autostart
This build is patched with =coolautostart=, No need to setup =.xinitrc= or any other startup script.
- =powertop= for better battery and power control in laptop
- =xbacklight= to setup the screen brightness, ~I like my screen dark~
- =xset= to setup cursor movement and fonts
- =pacman= to list my packages (delete this in =config.def.h= if you use non-Arch distro)

- =nitrogen= to set wallpaper
- =picom= for compositor
